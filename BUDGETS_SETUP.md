# 🏀 Full-Stack Budget Management Setup

## Overview
The budget page has been completely redesigned to match your Figma design and is now fully connected to Supabase for enterprise-level data management.

## ✨ Features Implemented

### Frontend (React + Ant Design)
- **Clean Header**: "Budgets" title with search and create button
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time search through budget names
- **Budget Cards**: 2x3 grid layout with progress bars
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints
- **Empty States**: Helpful messaging when no budgets exist
- **Budget Creation**: Right-side drawer with simplified form (name, amount, period, description, auto-repeat)

### Backend (Next.js API + Supabase)
- **Real-time Data**: Live budget data from Supabase database
- **Spending Calculations**: Automatic calculation of spent vs. budget
- **Progress Visualization**: Color-coded progress bars based on spending percentage
- **Search & Filtering**: Server-side search with season filtering
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete budgets

### Security Features
- **Enterprise Security**: Built on the security foundation we implemented
- **Data Validation**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Audit Logging**: All budget operations are logged for compliance

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Database Setup
Run the sample data migration to populate budgets:

```sql
-- Copy and run the contents of database/migrations/001_populate_budgets.sql
-- This will create 6 sample budgets with realistic spending data
```

### 2. Test the Application
1. Navigate to `/budgets` in your app
2. You should see the 6 budget cards with real data
3. Try the search functionality
4. Click "Create New Bucket" to open the budget creation drawer

### 3. API Endpoints
- `GET /api/budgets` - Fetch budgets with spending calculations
- `POST /api/budgets` - Create new budget (simplified without categories)
- `GET /api/budget-categories` - Fetch available categories (currently unused)

## 🎨 Design Features

### Progress Bar Colors
- 🟢 **Green** (#34c759): < 60% spent (healthy)
- 🟠 **Orange** (#ff9500): 60-80% spent (caution)
- 🔴 **Red** (#ff3b30): > 80% spent (over budget)

### Budget Categories
- Equipment & Maintenance
- Travel & Transportation  
- Food & Catering
- Tournament & League Fees
- Coaching & Training

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Budget Categories
Categories are currently disabled. To re-enable:
1. Update the `CreateBudgetDrawer` component to include category selection
2. Modify the budgets API to handle categoryId
3. Update the budget creation form validation

### Modifying Budget Periods
Update the period options in `CreateBudgetDrawer/index.tsx`:
```typescript
<Select.Option value="Custom">Custom Period</Select.Option>
```

### Changing Season
Update the season parameter in the API calls:
```typescript
const season = '2025-2026'; // Change this to your season
```

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints
- **Desktop**: 3-column grid
- **Tablet**: 2-column grid  
- **Mobile**: Single column with stacked header

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### No Budgets Showing
1. Check if the migration script was run
2. Verify Supabase connection
3. Check browser console for API errors

### Search Not Working
1. Ensure the search API endpoint is accessible
2. Check if budgets exist in the database
3. Verify the search parameter is being sent correctly

### Create Budget Fails
1. Check required fields (name, amount, period, categoryId)
2. Verify budget categories exist in the database
3. Check Supabase permissions for the budgets table

## 🔒 Security Notes
- All budget operations are logged for audit purposes
- Input validation prevents malicious data entry
- Database queries use parameterized statements
- User authentication and authorization are enforced

## 📈 Next Steps
1. **Budget Editing**: Add edit functionality for existing budgets
2. **Budget Deletion**: Implement soft delete with confirmation
3. **Budget History**: Track budget changes over time
4. **Export Features**: PDF/Excel export of budget reports
5. **Notifications**: Alert when budgets approach limits
