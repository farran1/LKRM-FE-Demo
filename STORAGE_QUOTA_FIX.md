# Storage Quota Management Fix

## Problem Solved
Fixed `QuotaExceededError: Failed to execute 'setItem' on 'Storage'` which occurred when the live stat tracker accumulated too much data in localStorage.

## Root Cause
The live stat tracker was saving:
- Complete game state every time stats were recorded
- All events, players, lineups, action history, substitution history
- No cleanup of old data
- No size limits or optimization

This could easily exceed the browser's localStorage quota (typically 5-10MB).

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ **1. Automatic Data Cleanup**
- **Weekly cleanup**: Removes game data older than 7 days
- **Emergency cleanup**: Triggered when quota is exceeded
- **Smart cleanup**: Keeps only essential data during emergencies

### ✅ **2. Data Size Optimization**
- **Event limiting**: Keeps only last 200 events per game (instead of unlimited)
- **Action history limiting**: Keeps only last 100 actions
- **Player data optimization**: Removes detailed action/substitution history per player
- **Size checking**: Warns and compresses data if it exceeds 1MB per game

### ✅ **3. Graceful Error Handling**
- **Quota detection**: Catches `QuotaExceededError` specifically
- **Automatic retry**: Cleans up data and retries with minimal data
- **User feedback**: Shows informative messages instead of crashes
- **Fallback mode**: Saves only essential data when storage is critically low

### ✅ **4. Storage Monitoring**
- **Usage tracking**: Monitors how much localStorage is being used
- **Percentage calculation**: Shows storage usage as percentage
- **Proactive warnings**: Alerts users when storage is getting full

## Technical Details

### Data Optimization Strategy
```javascript
// Before: Unlimited data storage
events: allEvents // Could be 1000+ events

// After: Optimized storage
events: gameData.events?.slice(-200) || [] // Last 200 events only
actionHistory: gameData.actionHistory?.slice(-100) || [] // Last 100 actions only
```

### Emergency Cleanup Process
1. **Detect quota exceeded error**
2. **Remove all games older than current session**
3. **Clear non-essential storage items**
4. **Save minimal data (last 50 events, essential state only)**
5. **Show user-friendly message**

### Storage Usage Monitoring
```javascript
const storageUsage = offlineStorage.getStorageUsage()
// Returns: { used: bytes, total: bytes, percentage: number }
```

## User Experience Improvements

### ✅ **Before Fix:**
- ❌ App would crash with `QuotaExceededError`
- ❌ No warning when storage was getting full
- ❌ Lost all game data on error
- ❌ No way to recover

### ✅ **After Fix:**
- ✅ Automatic cleanup prevents quota issues
- ✅ Graceful degradation to minimal data if needed
- ✅ User-friendly messages: "Storage space low. Automatically cleaned up old data..."
- ✅ Game continues to work even with full storage
- ✅ Essential data is always preserved

## Performance Benefits

1. **Smaller data storage** = faster saves/loads
2. **Automatic cleanup** = consistent performance over time
3. **Optimized data structure** = reduced memory usage
4. **Proactive management** = prevents crashes

## Configuration

### Limits Set:
- **Game data retention**: 7 days
- **Events per game**: 200 (sufficient for most games)
- **Action history**: 100 items
- **Game history**: 20 games maximum
- **Per-game size limit**: 1MB (with compression if exceeded)

### Emergency Thresholds:
- **Minimal data mode**: Last 50 events only
- **Essential data only**: Game state + players + basic stats
- **User notification**: Shown if even minimal save fails

## Testing
The system now handles:
- ✅ Long games with 500+ stat events
- ✅ Multiple games in browser session
- ✅ Browser storage quota limits
- ✅ Corrupted/invalid localStorage data
- ✅ Emergency storage situations

## Future Considerations
- Could implement IndexedDB for larger storage capacity
- Could add compression algorithms for even smaller data
- Could sync to cloud storage as backup
- Could add user controls for data retention periods
